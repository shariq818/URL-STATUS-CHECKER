A beginner-friendly Python script that checks whether websites are *online or offline*.  
You simply provide a text file containing URLs (one per line), and the script prints each website’s status directly in the *CMD/terminal*.  
Perfect for learning automation, networking basics, and building your GitHub portfolio.

### *How to Use*
1. Place your .txt file with URLs in the same folder as the script.
2. Run the script.
3. Enter your file name when asked.
4. The script displays each URL as:
- *Online (200 OK)*
- *Offline*
- *Unreachable / Error*

Fast, simple, and clean — ideal for entry-level cybersecurity or automation workflows.
